A personal site I designed and built, pour moi. Complicated view management stuff done with Backbone.js.

Features
--------
* A persistent audio player footer that can be paused and skipped.
* Fast-loading animated GIF previews for all projects.
* Neat CSS3 transitions and animations.
* Clean and responsive design.
