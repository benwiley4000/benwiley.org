A personal site I designed and built, pour moi. Complicated view management stuff done with Backbone.js.

Features
--------
* A persistent audio player footer that can be paused and skipped.
* Reasonably fast-loading animated GIF previews for all projects.
* A neat effect on view swap: container collapsing with `max-height:0;transform:scaleY(0)`.
* Clean and responsive design.
