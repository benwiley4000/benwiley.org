A personal site I designed and built, pour moi. Complicated view management stuff done with Backbone.js.

Features
--------
* A built-from-scratch persistent audio player footer that supports pausing, skipping and fast, responsive seeking.
* Fast-loading animated GIF previews for all projects, tap-to-play.
* Neat CSS3 transitions and animations.
* Clean and responsive design.
